    "An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. Two words are anagrams to each other if we can get one from another by rearranging the letters. Anagrams are case-insensitive and don't take account whitespaces.

    "\n",
    "In computer science, a stack is a particular kind of data type or collection in which the principal operations in the collection are the addition of an entity to the collection (also known as push) and the removal of an entity (also known as pop). The relation between the push and pop operations is such that the stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. In a LIFO data structure, the last element added to the structure must be the first one to be removed. Often a peek, or top operation is also implemented, returning the value of the top element without removing it.\n",

    "We will emulate the stack process with Python. You are given a sequence of commands:\n",
    "- \"PUSH X\" -- add X in the stack, where X is a digit.\n",

    "The stack can only contain digits.\n",

The value is a float number with decimal after the point (decimals argument; default 0). For the value, use the rounding towards zero rule (5.6⇒5, -5.6⇒-5) if the decimal = 0, otherwise use the standard rounding procedure. If the number of decimals is greater than the current number of digits after dot, trail value with zeroes. The number should be a value with letters designating the power. You will be given a list of power designations (powers argument; default ['', 'k', 'M', 'G', 'T', 'P', 'E', 'Z', 'Y']). If you are given suffix (suffix argument; default ‘’) , then you must append it. If you don’t have enough powers - stay at the maximum. And zero is always zero without powers, but with suffix.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Playfair cipher or Playfair square, is a manual symmetric encryption technique and was the first literal digraph substitution cipher. The scheme was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone, but bears the name of Lord Playfair who promoted the use of the cipher. The Playfair cipher uses a 5 by 5 table containing a keyword or phrase. Memorization of the keyword and 4 simple rules are all that’s required to create the 5 by 5 table and use the cipher. For this mission, we will do one better and use a 6 by 6 table.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the key table, we should use ASCII letters in lowercase (\"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\") and digits (\"0123456789\"). They are have the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate the key table, the spaces in the table must be filled with the letters contained in the keyword (dropping any duplicate letters and digits), then the remaining spaces are filled with the rest of the letters and digits of the alphabet in order. The key is written in the top rows of the table, from left to right. The keyword together with the conventions for filling in the 6 by 6 table constitute the cipher key.\n",
    "\n",
    "To encrypt a message, we will need to prepare a block of text. Upper case letters get transposed into lower case of letters, we’d break the message into digraphs (groups of 2 letters) and skip white spaces and punctuation symbols. The result would turn a message like \"Hello World!\" into \"he ll ow or ld\", and would get mapped out in the key table. The two letters of the digraph are considered to be the opposite corners of a rectangle in the key table. Note the relative position of the corners of this rectangle. Then apply the following 4 rules, in order, to each pair of letters in the plaintext:\n",
    "\n",
    "Prepare text: convert to lowercase, remove all non-useable symbols (white spaces, punctuation etc) and break the message into digraphs. If both letters are the same, add an \"x\" after the first letter (for double \"x\" use \"z\" as completion character) and shift following digraphs. If needed, append a \"z\" to complete the final digraph (or \"x\" if the last letter is \"z\"). For example \"pp dr ...\" will become \"px pd r...\" before encoding and \"xx zz ...\" will became \"xz xz z...\".\n",
    "If the letters appear on the same row of your table, replace them with the letters to their immediate right respectively (wrapping around to the left side of the row if a letter in the original pair was on the right side of the row).\n",
    "If the letters appear on the same column of your table, replace them with the letters immediately below respectively (wrapping around to the top side of the column if a letter in the original pair was on the bottom side of the column).\n",
    "If the letters are not on the same row or column, replace them with the letters on the same row respectively but at the other pair of corners of the rectangle defined by the original pair. The order is important – the first letter of the encrypted pair is the one that lies on the same row as the first letter of the plaintext pair.\n",
    "To decrypt, use the inverse (opposite) of the last 3 rules and you will get the processed (cut version)."
