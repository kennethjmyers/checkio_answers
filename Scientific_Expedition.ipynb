    "## 1 Verify Anagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. Two words are anagrams to each other if we can get one from another by rearranging the letters. Anagrams are case-insensitive and don't take account whitespaces. For example: \"Gram Ring Mop\" and \"Programming\" are anagrams. But \"Hello\" and \"Ole Oh\" are not.\n",

    "\n",
    "In computer science, a stack is a particular kind of data type or collection in which the principal operations in the collection are the addition of an entity to the collection (also known as push) and the removal of an entity (also known as pop). The relation between the push and pop operations is such that the stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. In a LIFO data structure, the last element added to the structure must be the first one to be removed. Often a peek, or top operation is also implemented, returning the value of the top element without removing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will emulate the stack process with Python. You are given a sequence of commands:\n",
    "- \"PUSH X\" -- add X in the stack, where X is a digit.\n",
    "- \"POP\" -- look and remove the top position. If the stack is empty, then it returns 0 (zero) and does nothing.\n",
    "- \"PEEK\" -- look at the top position. If the stack is empty, then it returns 0 (zero).\n",
    "The stack can only contain digits.\n",

The first digits for the minutes and seconds have a length of 3 while the second digits for the minutes and seconds have a length of 4. Every digit in the time is converted to binary representation.
