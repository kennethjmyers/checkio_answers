    "An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. Two words are anagrams to each other if we can get one from another by rearranging the letters. Anagrams are case-insensitive and don't take account whitespaces.

    "\n",
    "In computer science, a stack is a particular kind of data type or collection in which the principal operations in the collection are the addition of an entity to the collection (also known as push) and the removal of an entity (also known as pop). The relation between the push and pop operations is such that the stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. In a LIFO data structure, the last element added to the structure must be the first one to be removed. Often a peek, or top operation is also implemented, returning the value of the top element without removing it.\n",

    "We will emulate the stack process with Python. You are given a sequence of commands:\n",
    "- \"PUSH X\" -- add X in the stack, where X is a digit.\n",

    "The stack can only contain digits.\n",

    "You should write a function for converting a number to string using several rules. First of all, you will need to cut the number with a given base (base argument; default 1000). The value is a float number with decimal after the point (decimals argument; default 0). For the value, use the rounding towards zero rule (5.6⇒5, -5.6⇒-5) if the decimal = 0, otherwise use the standard rounding procedure. If the number of decimals is greater than the current number of digits after dot, trail value with zeroes. The number should be a value with letters designating the power. You will be given a list of power designations (powers argument; default ['', 'k', 'M', 'G', 'T', 'P', 'E', 'Z', 'Y']). If you are given suffix (suffix argument; default ‘’) , then you must append it. If you don’t have enough powers - stay at the maximum. And zero is always zero without powers, but with suffix.\n",
