    "\n",
    "Errors during transcription are rather common. Unintentional keystrokes can cause characters to be rearranged, dropped or inserted in manually typed text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily for the robots, you have ways to solve problems like this. Your CheckSum helps to reduce the likelihood of errors by introducing a final character that is calculated from the previous characters. With the proper reasoning, the final character can always be calculated. This way, when inputs are entered, you can instantly verify that the final character matches the character predicted by CheckSum. If the two do not match, the input is rejected. The end result is that you would see fewer data entry errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "How CheckSum Works:\n",
    "CheckSum reasoning will need map points. This is a definition lookup for how to process the input necessary to generate the final character, which will be enable us instantly verify that our input is correct. In other words, for each sequence character of the input, we are confident there can only be one possible input, all thanks to this final character. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps you must take to obtain the final character are as follows: \n",
    "From the rightmost input, traverse from right to left, and apply 'map point character lookup' for even-indexed characters.\n",
    "Add map point results for even-indexed characters with the unchanged digits from the original number.\n",
    "Find the remainder of this sum with 10. For an example sum of 67, the remainder is 7. ( 67 modulo 10 = 7 )\n",
    "Your final character should be 0 if the sum is a multiple-of-10, but it should be 10 minus remainder if the sum is not a multiple-of-10.\n",
    "To generate the 'map point character lookup' table: \n",
    "Double the value of a character.\n",
    "If the product of this doubling operation is greater than 9 (e.g: 7 * 2 = 14), reduce it by summing the digits of the product. (i.e., find its digital root. e.g., 10: 1 + 0 = 1, 14: 1 + 4 = 5) Only do this once. Even if the sum is greater than 9, leave it alone."

Some groups know about how big the pie was after Sophia removed it from the oven, but other groups don't know this and think the remaining part is the entire pie, then take their portion from the remaining. So each group had divided (mentally) the remaining or initial pie at all and took their part. How many parts will remain after all of the drones return?\n",

This leaves 10/18=5/9. The last group is 3 drones, which heard about the original size of the pie from Sophia. They took half of the original pie, so the remaining is 5/9 - 3/6 = 1/18\n",
