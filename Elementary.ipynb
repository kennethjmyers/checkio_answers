    "\n",
    "In mathematics and mathematical logic, Boolean algebra is a sub-area of algebra in which the values of the variables are true or false, typically denoted with 1 or 0 respectively. Instead of elementary algebra where the values of the variables are numbers and the main operations are addition and multiplication, the main operations of Boolean algebra are the conjunction (denoted ∧), the disjunction (denoted ∨) and the negation (denoted ¬).\n",

    "- \"conjunction\" denoted x ∧ y, satisfies x ∧ y = 1 if x = y = 1 and x ∧ y = 0 otherwise.\n",
    "- \"disjunction\" denoted x ∨ y, satisfies x ∨ y = 0 if x = y = 0 and x ∨ y = 1 otherwise.\n",
    "- \"implication\" (material implication) denoted x→y and can be described as ¬ x ∨ y. If x is true then the value of x → y is taken to be that of y. But if x is false then the value of y can be ignored; however the operation must return some truth value and there are only two choices, so the return value is the one that entails less, namely true.\n",
    "- \"exclusive\" (exclusive or) denoted x ⊕ y and can be described as (x ∨ y)∧ ¬ (x ∧ y). It excludes the possibility of both x and y. Defined in terms of arithmetic it is addition mod 2 where 1 + 1 = 0.\n",
    "- \"equivalence\" denoted x ≡ y and can be described as ¬ (x ⊕ y). It's true just when x and y have the same value.\n",
